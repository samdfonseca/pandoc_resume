Experience
----------

**The New York Times: 2018-Present**

Building data systems that enable targeted experiences on NYT
properties. As a platform team, our clients are engineers and
analysts that need to access analytics data in low latency
situations, such as programatic advertising.

* Developing the [new advertising data platform](https://open.nytimes.com/to-serve-better-ads-we-built-our-own-data-program-c5e039bf247b)
  to replace all third-party data with proprietary [first-party data](https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-advertising-792b3cd6-4bdb-47c3-9817-36601211a79d.html).

* Lead design and implementation of multi-tenant Data Service Request
  automation platform for teams to manage removal of users' data.

**Axial: 2017-2018**

* Taught developers various best practices for writing better tests, such as external service mocking and data-driven
    testing.

* Designed and implemented a refactoring of Axial’s core service that eliminated all database dependencies from our test
    suite, reducing test suite execution time from ~15 minutes to ~2 minutes.

**CrowdTwist: 2016-2017**

* Worked full-time on end-to-end and integration level test automation.

* Automated all manual regression testing for batch jobs, reducing the time needed to verify a release by a full day.

**Bypass Mobile: 2014-2016**

* Developed automated testing suite with a focus on testing across independent microservices and application
    infrastructure.

* Supported numerous non-traditional Android behaviors and uses, such as Ethernet connections, USB and network-based
    printers, and multi-APK applications.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Go:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
